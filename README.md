### Hi there 👋

I'm Gaby, a Software Developer currently working on Rails & Backbone.js apps at work.

When I'm not working:
- 🤱 I'm raising a toddler & 2 Standard Poodles.
- ✨ I’m currently working on updating my personal portfolio site, gabycastaneda.com (for now, gabihuizar.github.io/Portfolio) & migrating it from WordPress to GitHub Pages/Jekyll.
- 👩🏽‍💻 I’m currently learning GraphQL.
